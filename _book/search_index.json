World 2016 Conference ReportLast Monday a couple of hundred members of scala's functional programming community turned out at the Rheged\nCentre in Penrith for two days of talks given by some of the most prominent experts in the language. The small-ish \nsize of the event no doubt in part due to it's relative inaccessibility, in more than one sense of the word. A fact the \norganisers seem fairly proud of.The stage was well set on the evening before the start of the conference when, on asking for three pints of a guest beer\ncalled Yolo at a local bar, a helpful voice chirped up 'I think you'll find that's Yolii'. Found the right place at\nleast then.The speaking line-up was a bit depleted due to several last minute drop-outs. This resulted in a bit of organisational\nconfusion as attendees were left without a schedule right up until the start of the conference on Monday morning. A\nfact that organiser Jon Pretty (Propensive) was reminded of repeatedly. All of the talks that did end up happening\nare listed in the table below.Highlights for me included: Raul Raja's talk on emerging FP patterns; Dave Gurnell's intro to Shapeless; and the live \ncoding session on free monads presented by Pawel Szulc.Day One\n\nTitle\nSpeaker\n\nCompilers are (in Memory) Databases\nMartin Odersky\nPractical ScalaCheck\nNoel Markham\nCBT: Fast, Intuitive, Convenient Scala Builds\nJan Christopher Vogts\nGeneric Derivation: The Hard Parts\nTravis Brown\nType Astronauts Guide to Shapeless\nDave Gurnell\nA Whirlwind Tour of scala.meta\nOlafur Pall Geirsson\nPure Functional Database Programming with Fixed Types\nRob Norris\nRun Wild, Run Free!\nRaul Raja\nEnterprise Algebras\nTim Perrett\nLearn You (Advanced) Akka Streams for Great Good!\nHeiko Seeberger\nDistributed Systems vs Compositionality\nRoland Kuhn\n\n\nDay Two\n\nTitle\nSpeaker\n\nScalaFiddle\nOtto Chrons\nFOR, What is it Good for?

A good example is the invariant described above for Math.abs, where it will return a \nnegative result when passed Int.MinValue as input, because the range of int on the JVM has one more negative value than\npositive.Slides - http://noelmarkham.github.io/practical-scalacheck/index.html#/Exercises - http://www.47deg.com/blog/scalacheck-for-scala-exercises"},"day_one/cbt.html":{"url":"day_one/cbt.html","title":"CBT","keywords":"","body":"CBT: Fast, Intuitive, Convenient Scala Builds - Jan Christopher VogtAlmost all scala projects are built with sbt. Originally the 'simple' build tool, the name had to be changed\nonce it had become laughably inaccurate. By creating CBT, Jan Christopher Vogt hopes to provide a simpler, faster\nalternative that integrates more naturally with the unix command-line, without losing the flexibility and power that\nare sbts strengths.The basic idea is that you create a Scala class to model your build, then override and/or add methods to set\nup the tasks that you need. CBT provides a few base classes and traits to mix in. A simple build might end up\nlooking something like this:import cbt._\n\nclass Build(val context: Context) extends BaseBuild(context) {\n  outer =>\n\n  override def dependencies: Seq[Dependency] = {\n    super.dependencies ++ Resolver(mavenCentral).bind(\n      ScalaDependency(\"com.example\", \"a-scala-library\", \"1.0\"),\n      MavenDependency(\"com.example\", \"a-java-library\", \"1.1\")\n    )\n  }\n  override def test: Option[ExitCode] = Some {\n    new BasicBuild(context) with ScalaTest {\n      // Depend on the main build class, plus dependencies from ScalaTest trait\n      override def dependencies = outer +: super.dependencies\n    }.run()\n  }\n\n  // Allows running `cbt foo` from the command line to call this method\n  def foo() = println(\"Hello world!\")\n}\nIt's also super easy to write plugins for CBT - literally just extend the cbt.Plugin trait, then any build class\nwhich extends it will have all of its methods available to use. So in the example above, we could have extracted the\nmethod foo() into a separate trait, and enabled our cbt foo command-line invocation by mixing it in.This looks like an interesting project, and sbt could certainly do with some competition, but I wonder whether\nall of the conceptual bulk of sbt (scopes, axes, configurations, etc.) accumulated for a reason and will either creep\ninto CBT over time or leak out in other ways.It was also clear that this is a pretty early-stage project, with a number of bugs and edge cases still to be ironed\nout. Currently installation is by means of cloning the source repository - it's unclear whether this will change in\nfuture. Vogt seems pretty keen for people to get involved; indeed, one of the reasons behind bootstrapping from source\nis so that people can understand the source code and hopefully contribute.A couple of great little tools came up during the talk:nailgun: Startup times for the JVM are ridiculously slow, making it a poor choice for short-lived jobs. Nailgun\n(http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/) solves this by keeping a JVM running in the background as a server and using\na client written in C to run tasks in it.  Bit of a revelation to see Java programs completing (kind of) with single\ndigit millisecond duration.\ncoursier: Coursier (https://github.com/alexarchambault/coursier) can be used as a drop-in replacement for the\ndefault Ivy dependency resolver used by sbt. Addresses one of the biggest gripes most people have with sbt (aside from\nthe fiddly setup); the amount of time spent sat there waiting for the 'Resolving...' message to go away.\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1odc1NbkpXPFuhnln-rusB1Dkk3dz7yOeHh0C9WDHodk/Earlier version of talk - http://www.nescala.org/2016/slides/cvogt.pdf"},"day_one/generic_derivation.html":{"url":"day_one/generic_derivation.html","title":"Generic Derivation","keywords":"","body":"Generic Derivation: The Hard Parts - Travis BrownA talk by Travis Brown, creator of the Circe (SUR-see, like in GoT) JSON library amongst other things, on the \ndifficulties of using generic programming to implement boilerplate-free marshalling/unmarshalling of JSON data.The title of the talk sounded a bit intimidating for me, so I went to the CBT one instead.Slides - https://meta.plasm.us/slides/scalaworld/#1"},"day_one/guide_to_shapeless.html":{"url":"day_one/guide_to_shapeless.html","title":"Type Astronauts Guide to Shapeless","keywords":"","body":"The Type Astronauts Guide to Shapeless - Dave GurnellIntroductory workshop on shapeless, the generic programming library for scala created by Miles Sabin.The core construct provided by the library is the HList (for heterogenous list), a data structure where the type (and\nnumber of) elements the list contains is reflected in it's type signature. So, for a list containing a String, an Int\nand a Boolean, we'd have something like:val strIntBool: String :: Int :: Boolean :: HNil = ???\nAs opposed to the following, which is what you would have if you put the same elements in a standard scala Seq, where\nthe only information it contains is the closest common ancestor of the element's types (Any):val strIntBool: Seq[Any] = ???\nShapeless also provides facilities to convert any case class or tuple to and from this representation, and to perform\ncollection style operations on HLists (e.g. map) in a typesafe manner.The library can be used to implement functionality that we might otherwise have used reflection for, e.g. take all the\nfields of any arbitrary object and write them out as a line of CSV data. The big advantage shapeless has is that this\ncan all be done without stepping outside the type system, therefore giving the compiler the opportunity to check our\nwork.Another thing introduced in this workshop was the concept of a coproduct - i.e. the dual of a product, analagous to\na sealed trait in much the same wasy as a HList is analagous to a tuple, in that it provides the same ability to\nabstract over type but with greater flexibility (and correspondingly longer type signatures). A simple example would look\nlike:sealed trait Shape\ncase class Rectangle() extends Shape\ncase class Circle() extends Shape\n\ntype ShapeRepr = Rectangle :+: Circle :+: CNil // CNil is the empty coproduct\n\nThere's a huge amount more to the library, all built around the same basic idea of typesafe generic programming.

Essentially if you have a Free[S, A],\nthen you can think of the Free as the program you are writing, the S as the language (or algebra) you are\nwriting it in, and the A as the value to be produced from your program. It's then possible to make a new program\nusing a coproduct (basically a union) of two algebras, to compose Frees.To apply this pattern, you also need an interpreter of type F ~> G (a \"natural transformation\", roughly\nequivalent to F[A] => G[A]). Interpreters can be used to convert between high-level and low-level ops, and can\nbe composed together with andThen.This talk made heavy use of scalaz, which by the end of it was starting to look like it might be pretty interesting\nto use.

Under this conceptual model, a routine that calls another routine fulfils the same role as the\nmaster loop of a computer game examining a node in a behaviour tree. If the call is implemented as a subroutine, as is\nthe norm, then the caller cedes control to the subroutine and resumes when it has completed. Implementing the call as\na coroutine instead allows for interaction (variable passing, flow of control) between the caller and callee.Ok, it's not really a concept I can easily distil down into a couple of sentences. Take a look at the slides.Anyway, the approach is interesting because it allows for concurrent and event-driven code to be implemented in a \ndirect programming style (i.e. as if single-threaded), as opposed to using callbacks or monadic composition. Think\nasync/await vs scala.concurrent.Future.Slides - http://axel22.github.io/slides/coroutines.html#/Repo - https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutinesAbstract:In today's era of distributed computing, reactivity and asynchronous, event-driven systems, computations must often wait until specific conditions are fulfilled. These conditions range from anything from an arrival of a network request or a keyboard stroke, to an external sensor triggering an event. The ability to suspend computations awaiting such events is more important than ever. Commonly, computations are suspended either by blocking the current execution thread, or by registering callbacks. The former has a negative impact on performance, and is typically shunned upon. The latter, which is an established practice today, comes with its own set of unpleasant syntactic overheads. Previous approaches to reduce these syntactic overheads were too focused at specific use-cases, and were not sufficiently general.In this talk, I show that it is possible to have the best of both worlds - to write direct-style, seemingly blocking programs, but use callbacks under-the-hood to improve program scalability and throughput. I will present first-class type-safe coroutines implemented in Scala, and show how they are used to implement more specific computation models, such as Async-Await, Erlang-style actors, and Esterel-style pause statements. I continue to show that coroutines are applicable to more easily implementing collection iterators, and allow more concise ScalaCheck-style testing. Finally, I show that Scala coroutines are equivalent to continuations in expressive power."},"day_two/quaich_serverless_microframework.html":{"url":"day_two/quaich_serverless_microframework.html","title":"quaich: Serverless Microframework","keywords":"","body":"quaich: A serverless microframework for event-driven Scala Programming on AWS Lambda - Brendan McAdamsSneak preview of a scala equivalent to Amazon's chalice, 'a serverless\nmicroframework for AWS'.AWS Lambda provides infrastructure to run your code on that is only actually 'allocated' when your code needs to run.\nIn response to an incoming event (HTTP request, S3 trigger) lambda will load your code into an execution environment,\nuse it to process the event and then deprovision the associated resources after, thus relieving you of the obligation \nto manage the infrastructure the code runs on.The function to be executed must implement an API supplied by AWS, and there's a fairly large amount of administrative\noverhead in configuring API gateways, permissions and uploading your code.

It uses staging to remove composition overhead at compile time to produce efficient, fast parsers. Its interface is almost similar to Scala's parser combinators.The main goal of parsequery is to systematically eliminate all intermediate data structures that are creating when running a traditional parser combinator program. Typically, parser combinators interleave static composition of parsers with the dynamic act of parsing itself, at runtime. The key insight is that we can fully decouple the static parts from the dynamic one.The presentation will go over the theory behind it, and how to leverage Scala macros and quasiquotes to implement this optimisation as a library."},"day_two/essential_vs_accidental_complexity_in_scala.html":{"url":"day_two/essential_vs_accidental_complexity_in_scala.html","title":"Essential vs Accidental Complexity in Scala","keywords":"","body":"Essential vs. Accidental Complexity in Scala & Dotty, Towards a Puzzler-Free Future - Andrew PhillipsMissed this one, abstract below.Abstract:(How) can we construct a programming language that is elegant without being elementary; expressive without becoming exasperating?

Boxing can lead to a lot of allocation and deallocation of small objects (the boxes) as inputs\nare unwrapped to get at their values and results of calculations are wrapped up in new boxes. Rapid allocation and\ndeallocation of objects causes pressure on the garbage collector which can be unacceptable for performance sensitive \ncode.Vlad's solution to this problem is to use a long value (64 bit integer) to wrap primitives, rather than an object. The\ntechnique is known as miniboxing, presumably because a long is a much smaller box than an object.To make this work, Vlad, with the help of other students at EPFL, needed to implement a compiler plugin and alternate\nversions of large parts of the standard library.Benchmarking has shown that miniboxing can deliver speedups in the range of 1.75x to 2.5x in some cases, though for\nsome code that has already been aggressively optimized (the spire numerics library was\ngiven as an example) the impact can be negligible and even negative.This looks like a really promising idea, but concerns were expressed over whether implementating it as a compiler \nplugin is the best approach.
